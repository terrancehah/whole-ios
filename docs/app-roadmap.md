# Whole App Creation Roadmap

This document provides a step-by-step guide for developing the Whole app, from backend integration to launch. Follow these steps sequentially for a smooth and scalable development process.

---

## Step 1: Backend Integration & Authentication
**Objective:** Establish a secure backend connection and user authentication.
- Implement `SupabaseService.swift` for all Supabase API/database calls.
- Create `AuthService.swift` for user sign-up, login, password reset, and session management.
**Why first?** All core features (quotes, favorites, onboarding, subscriptions) require backend and authentication.
**Outcome:** The app can securely connect to Supabase and authenticate users.

---

## Step 2: Define Core Data Models & View Models
**Objective:** Set up robust data structures and business logic.
- Create `QuoteModel.swift` for quote data (English/Chinese, categories, etc.).
- Create `UserModel.swift`, `SubscriptionModel.swift`, and `UserQuoteModel.swift` as needed.
- Develop `QuoteViewModel.swift` for fetching/managing quotes.
**Why now?** Models and view models are the foundation for UI and data flow.
**Outcome:** The app can retrieve, manage, and display bilingual quote data.

---

## Step 3: Build Reusable UI Components
**Objective:** Create modular UI for consistent user experience.
- Implement `QuoteCardView.swift` in `Components/` for displaying a bilingual quote card.
- Add `CustomButton.swift` and other reusable elements.
**Why now?** Modular components are reused across features and speed up UI development.
**Outcome:** The app has polished, reusable UI building blocks.

---

## Step 4: Main Quote Browsing Interface
**Objective:** Enable users to browse and interact with quotes.
- Build `QuoteListView.swift` for swipeable quote cards.
- Integrate like/save and share actions.
- Enforce free user swipe limits.
**Why now?** This is the core user experience and validates backend/UI integration.
**Outcome:** Users can browse, like, and share daily quotes.

---

## Step 5: Widget Development
**Objective:** Deliver quotes directly to usersâ€™ lock screen/standby.
- Set up `QuoteWidget.swift` and `WidgetEntry.swift` with WidgetKit.
- Ensure widget displays daily bilingual quotes, updates, and deep links to the app.
**Why early?** The widget is a signature feature and must be tested alongside core quote logic.
**Outcome:** Quotes appear on lock/standby screens as designed.

---

## Step 6: Onboarding Flow
**Objective:** Guide new users and collect preferences.
- Build `OnboardingView.swift` (welcome, widget intro, category selection, etc.).
- Implement `OnboardingViewModel.swift` for onboarding logic.
**Why now?** Onboarding improves first-time user experience and sets up personalization.
**Outcome:** New users are smoothly introduced and their preferences are captured.

---

## Step 7: Paywall & Subscription Logic
**Objective:** Monetize via subscriptions and manage access.
- Implement `PaywallView.swift` for subscription options/free trial.
- Develop `PaywallViewModel.swift` for StoreKit integration and subscription logic.
**Why now?** Monetization should follow onboarding and precede premium feature access.
**Outcome:** Users can subscribe for unlimited/premium features.

---

## Step 8: Settings & Customization
**Objective:** Let users personalize their experience.
- Create `SettingsView.swift` for general settings.
- Build `CategorySelectionView.swift` for quote category preferences.
- Implement `CustomizationView.swift` for theme/background/font.
- Develop `SettingsViewModel.swift` for managing settings.
**Why now?** Personalization increases retention and enhances the core experience.
**Outcome:** Users can tailor the app to their preferences.

---

## Step 9: Favorites Feature
**Objective:** Enable saving and revisiting favorite quotes.
- Build `FavoritesView.swift` to display saved quotes.
- Create `FavoritesViewModel.swift` for managing favorites (persisted via Supabase).
**Why now?** Favorites build on quote browsing and require authentication.
**Outcome:** Users can save and revisit liked quotes.

---

## Step 10: Sharing Functionality
**Objective:** Allow users to share quotes as images.
- Implement `ShareSheet.swift` for sharing options.
- Create `QuoteImageGenerator.swift` to generate shareable images (with watermark for free users).
**Why now?** Sharing expands reach and leverages the completed quote UI.
**Outcome:** Users can share quotes on social media.

---

## Step 11: User-Generated Quotes (Premium)
**Objective:** Let premium users create and submit their own quotes.
- Build `UserQuoteEditorView.swift` for quote creation.
- Integrate with `SupabaseService.swift` to save user quotes (subscription-gated).
**Why now?** This premium feature depends on subscriptions and backend integration.
**Outcome:** Premium users can contribute quotes.

---

## Step 12: Notifications & Analytics
**Objective:** Enhance engagement and gather usage insights.
- Set up `NotificationService.swift` for daily quote notifications (user-scheduled).
- Implement `AnalyticsService.swift` for tracking user behavior.
**Why now?** These features complement the app once core flows are stable.
**Outcome:** Users receive daily quotes and analytics provide actionable insights.

---

## Step 13: Theming & Styling
**Objective:** Ensure a cohesive, attractive design.
- Use `Theme.swift` for colors, fonts, and appearance.
- Apply consistent theming across all screens and components.
**Why now?** Visual polish comes after core features are functional.
**Outcome:** The app has a consistent, appealing look.

---

## Step 14: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Objective:** Ensure reliability and catch bugs before release.
- Write unit tests for critical models/services (e.g., `QuoteViewModel.swift`, `AuthService.swift`).
- Create UI tests for key flows (onboarding, paywall, quote browsing).
**Why last?** Testing validates the entire app after feature completion.
**Outcome:** The app is stable and ready for App Store submission.

---

## Step 15: Final Review & Launch
**Objective:** Prepare for App Store submission and launch.
- Review all features, polish UI, and fix outstanding bugs.
- Prepare App Store assets, descriptions, and screenshots.
- Submit for review and monitor analytics post-launch.
**Outcome:** Whole is available for users, with a plan for post-launch improvements.
